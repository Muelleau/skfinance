_pronunciation: (es-kay-finance)_

SkFinance is a tutorial of a financial models and numerical methods organized into a 
library that is useful for many things in computational finance.

Mostly, this is a collection of interesting topics via clean code. This is not an applied
library: there are impractical methods here, and performance could be improved by implementation
in a faster runtime.

That being said, this is very useful for LEARNING computational financial methods and
for having a quick implementation that can used on the JVM.
